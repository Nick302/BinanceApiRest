<h3>I use the binance api for my purposes📝</h3>

We interact with BINANCE API 📈, get a response in the amount of ➕2000 currency pairs, for them there are entities and saved in our database processing MYSQL, then a separate service is a telegram bot that uses our ENDPOINT and gives the opportunity to request information.

If there was logic or algorithms, I would be happy to implement it, but I am not very good at trading :c🐳
